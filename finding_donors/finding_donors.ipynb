    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",

    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods, SVM, SGDC since finding donors is a classification problem and also a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "- For Gaussian Naive Bayes, it is used to classify an incoming email as spam or not spam from the lecture. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier is very robust to irrelevant features. Also, Gaussian Naive Bayes is efficient for training since it is computational efficient. The model performs well when all the features have the strong conditionally independence given the labels and when all the features are equally important. The weaknesses of the model, as mentioned previously, are it requires strong independence assumptions and all the features have the equal effects. This model is a good candidate for the problem because, first, this is a classification problem. Second, all the features such as workclass, education level, hours-per-week satisifies the conditionally indepence assumption. Third, it looks like there is no \"main effect\" in the features.\n",
    "- For Decision Trees, the algorithm such as ID3 used for medical text classification[1]. Decision Tree method works fast for training because of it's computational efficient; it can handle messy data such as continous and discrete data as well as numerical and categorical data, missing data and various feature types; it has ability to deal with the irrelevant data. It is alse simple to understand and interpret this model. The Decision Tree model performs well when it has a large data set. While the weaknesses of this model are it is not robust because some small change in the training data will cause very different result. Also, it is can be overfit so that it can not generlize well if we classified the data in much detail. When the data set is small, it probabiliy performs poorly. This method is a good candidate for this problem because it is a classification problem and all the features contains the messy data such as numerical and catagorical data.\n",
    "- For Ensemble Methods, the person recognitions such as face and speech recognition are widely studied using ensemble methods.[2] This method is also comoutational efficient; there is no difficult parameters to set as well as it can use variety of base learner such as the algorithm AdaBoost. It method does not overfit in some cases. It's performance depends on the base learner, for example, if the base learner is the Decision Tree, it performs well if it has a large data set. The weaknesses of the ensemble methods such as Adaboost algorithm, it seems susceptible to the uniform noise; the weak learner should not be too complex in order to avoid overfitting and also, it needs enough data to meet the requirement of the weak learner. So if the data is noisy or the weak learner is too complex and there is no enough data to meet the weak learner's requirement, it performs poorly. Since the Decision Tree and Gaussian Naive Bayes are good candidates for this problem, for the same reason, the ensemble methods is also a good candidate because it can use Decision Tree and Gaussian Naive Bayes mehtod as it's base learner. <br>\n",

    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",

    "SVC gets the highest $F_\\beta$-score and accuracy score on the test set among the three learners since it would seem that using accuracy as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that does not make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to CharityML, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than $50,000 is more important than the model's ability to recall those individuals. We can use F-beta score as a metric that considers both precision and recall.\n",
